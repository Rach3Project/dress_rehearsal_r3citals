# Dress Rehearsal R3cital Series

The goal of the Rach3 Project is studying the process of piano rehearsal using data-driven computational models. A central component of the project involves collecting a large, multimodal dataset of piano rehearsals, the Rach3 Dataset. An essential part of any musician's journey is what happens during a live performance. After all, rehearsals are ultimately aimed at performing in public. 

With this in mind, we are thrilled to introduce the **Dress Rehearsal R3cital Series** (yes, the spelling is intentional!). This series is designed with two objectives in mind:

1. To give pianists contributing data to the Rach3 dataset a clear performance goal, bringing focus and direction to their rehearsals.
2. To create a comparative snapshot of their progress, contrasting practice-phase performances with those in a live concert setting.
3. To simulate the pressures and dynamics of a real concert, the Dress Rehearsal R3cital Series performances will be recorded with the same multimodal setup we use in our rehearsal sessions  and will also be live-streamed on YouTube to an online audience.
